# Past Projects

Automated conveyer system with iOS application:

The iOS application - I initiated the development of an iOS application from the ground up using TBXML, HTTPRequest, CoreData, CoreGraphics, CoreLocation, CoreMedia, MessageUI, DragonMobile (speech kit), RedLaser (barcode scanner), and InAppSettingsKit. This project required an iOS application to create and store information with the help of any/all iOS sensors to a local sqlite database that could be retrieved at any time. This application is soon to be released.

The Machine - I got to reverse engineer a previous prototype to design and program this current version. I worked closely with a fabricator to develop smoother and more efficient operations on this rendition. I initially set it up with manual operation of stepper motors, actuators, and solenoids with a custom built remote to control the unit until all of the clearances were in order. Then I built an automated system with an Arduino microprocessor and sensors that were installed all across the machine to detect those clearances and perform operations requested by the iOS device. I am currently the technology development director for its prototypical phases by continuing project consulting services.
